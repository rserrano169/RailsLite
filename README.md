## Rails Lite

**This project utilizes Ruby's class system and WEBrick module in order to**
**implement some of the basic functions of Rails.**

To run:

  * Download .zip file from menu bar on the right.
  * Open terminal and navigate to "RailsLite-master".
  * Bundle install.
  * Run irb server/run.rb to start server.
  * Open browser and navigate to "localhost:3000".

Some test models, controllers, routes, and views were added in order to
demonstrate functionality. You can edit or add your own models, controllers, routes,
and views, similarly to how you might in Ruby on Rails.
