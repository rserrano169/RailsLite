## Rails Lite

**This project utilizes Ruby's class system and WEBrick module in order to**
**implement some of the basic functions of Rails.**

To run:

  * Download .zip file from menu bar on the right.
  * Open the terminal and navigate to the "RailsLite-master" directory.
  * Bundle install.
  * Execute command "irb server/run.rb" to start the WEBrick server.
  * Open a browser and navigate to "localhost:3000".

Some test models, controllers, routes, and views were added in order to
demonstrate functionality. You can edit or add your own models, controllers, routes,
and views, similarly to how you might in Ruby on Rails.
